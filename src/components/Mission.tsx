            TinyStage Concert Series is an intimate live music platform created
            to amplify the voices of underrepresented artists in Erie.
          </p>
          <p>
            Born from a desire to make arts spaces more inclusive, welcoming,
            and reflective of the city's multicultural richness, TinyStage
            exists not to import talent—but to uplift the creative brilliance
            that already lives here.
          </p>
          <p className='font-medium text-orange-600'>
            What would it look like if Erie's arts scene truly reflected the
            city's cultural richness?
          </p>
          <p>
            We celebrate local performers from diverse backgrounds by partnering
            with them to co-curate one-of-a-kind concert experiences that
            reflect their vision, style, and story.
          </p>
          <p className='font-semibold'>
            Our mission is to reshape the narrative of who belongs on stage—and
            to build a stage big enough for everyone.
